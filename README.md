Programs
========

Store for practice programs

This is where all my computer programs are going to reside.

The programming languages I am interested in:
First subset:
- C //Stopped after a little while
- Scala //Just started
- Go

Second subset:
- Perl
- Python
- Javascript

Third subset:
- Common Lisp or OCaml
- Haskell

Ignored:
- Java //Started and left. It doesn't suit my style and for rapid prototyping. Too verbose.
- Objective-C or Swift //Not anytime sooner
